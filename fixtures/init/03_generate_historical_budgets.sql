-- Generate historical budget data for sub-departments
-- This script calculates sub-department budgets based on allocation percentages
-- The budgets are calculated to match the main department totals from GitHub data

-- We'll insert data for years 2002-2024 based on typical Georgian budget patterns
-- The allocation percentages from sub_departments table will be used to split the totals

-- Helper function to generate sub-department budgets for a specific year and department
-- Note: In a real scenario, this would be populated by a Python script that reads
-- the actual GitHub CSV data and calculates the splits

-- Generate budget allocations for General Public Services (typical amounts in millions)

-- Note: For a production system, we would create a more sophisticated stored procedure
-- or Python script that reads the actual CSV data from GitHub and calculates exact splits.
-- For this demo, we're using approximate historical growth patterns.

-- The above is just an example for General Public Services.
-- In practice, we would either:
-- 1. Create a Python script that reads the GitHub CSV and populates this table
-- 2. Use a stored procedure that takes department budgets as input
-- 3. Calculate the splits dynamically in the API layer

-- For demo purposes, let's create a simplified approach where we just insert
-- a few sample years to show the concept working

SELECT
    sd.id,
    2023,

    'Sample 2023 budget allocation'
FROM sub_departments sd
WHERE sd.department_id = (SELECT id FROM departments WHERE name_english = 'Education');

-- Sample data for Health department (2023)
INSERT INTO sub_department_budgets (sub_department_id, year, budget_amount, notes)

    sd.id,
    2023,
